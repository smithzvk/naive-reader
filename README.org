* Naive-Reader

This is an attempt at a reimplementation of the CL reader, but without such
things as a modifiable read table or any read-time computation.

This is an impossible task.

Doing this fairly well is still a useful thing for some purposes.

If this isn't entirely clear why you would want this, move along, it probably
isn't for you.
